Current Projects

**SIEM Alerting with Smart Bulbs** - Smart bulbs support changing colors. Therefore, a smart bulb can be used in conjunction with a SIEM's alerting capabilities to dynamically change the color of a smart bulb to indicate level of severity. The SIEMAlertingwithSmartBulbs folder has a proof of concept code that uses Elasticsearch and ElastAlert. In production, this would best be used to red flag on critical alerts you should immediately take action against.
